I have been working as a software developer for 12 years actively(this year 2022), I am originally a physics
graduate, I worked as a full-stack frontend and backend developer in most projects, I have mostly written PHP for
the last 6-7 years. Big data and artificial intelligence always attract my attention. I have been working on these two
issues frequently lately, When the team could not find a developer to code a language they needed, I took this
responsibility many times and fulfilled it, yes I am a PHP developer, but I don't just write PHP.
I write in languages such as golang, python, javascript bash, etc, I have worked in many different positions for
years, as a developer, as a server administrator, as a team leader, etc. software is not just about writing code
software is a data structure
